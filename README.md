# What is this App? 
An integrated consumer app that saves recipes but helps individuals order take-out based on recently saved recipes [or ingredients bought from food delivery applications, such as Amazon Fresh]. 

Real World Problem: Living healthy on the run, on a busy night, while keeping to individual preferences on meals. The App includes a social media component to include friends and bring a network around recipes and getting together for dinner. 

Real World Solution:  Integrated App that bridges personal recipe/DIY meals with takeout and connection with Yelp GraphQL

# Project Requirements
Your group will use everything youâ€™ve learned throughout this course to create a MERN stack single-page application that works with real-world data to solve a real-world challenge, with a focus on user demand. The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfill some specific requirements.

Your project should fulfill the following requirements:

Use React for the front end.

Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.

Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.

Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.

Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

Have a polished UI.

Be responsive.

Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

Include authentication (JWT).

Protect sensitive API key information on the server.

Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
